                  College counseling is a service that assists students in the

                <div class="answer">
                  College counseling can begin as early as high school, but it's
                  most common during the junior and senior years to prepare for
                  college applications.

                <div class="answer">
                  Financial aid options include scholarships, grants, loans, and
                  work-study programs. Start by completing the FAFSA to
                  determine your eligibility.

                <div class="answer">
                  Scholarships are typically merit-based and awarded for
                  academic achievements or specific talents. Grants, on the
                  other hand, are need-based and provided to students based on
                  their financial circumstances. Both can help offset the cost
                  of education.
